# codealpha_tasks_2
Draw → Predict → Recognize! An interactive handwriting recognition tool powered by deep learning (EMNIST + MNIST).
# ✍️ Handwriting Recognition (Digits + Letters)

This project is a **handwriting recognition app** built with **TensorFlow/Keras + Tkinter**.  
It can recognize both **digits (0–9)** and **letters (A–Z)** using a **CNN trained on EMNIST + MNIST** datasets.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Recognizes **digits (0–9)** and **uppercase letters (A–Z)**.
- First run → trains CNN model and saves as `handwriting_model.h5`.
- Later runs → loads model instantly (no retraining).
- Interactive **Tkinter GUI**: draw, predict, and clear canvas.

## 📦 Setup

### 1. Clone Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwriting-recognition.git
cd handwriting-recognition
2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download EMNIST Dataset
## Dataset
This project uses:
- [EMNIST Letters](https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset)  
- MNIST (auto-downloaded via Keras)

Place the `.gz` files inside a folder named `gzip/` in the project root:
/gzip/emnist-letters-train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz
/gzip/emnist-letters-train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz
/gzip/emnist-letters-test-images-idx3-ubyte.gz
/gzip/emnist-letters-test-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz

▶️ Run the App
python handwriting_app.py


Draw digits/letters on the canvas.

Click Predict to see the result.

Click Clear to reset the canvas.
